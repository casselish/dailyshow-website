  <p> The Daily Show is a satirical news show on Comedy Central. I started watching it when I was in elementary school, and since then I've grown interested
    in its history -- more specifically the ways in which it paved the way for other satirical shows, as well as the ways in which
    it used its platform to affect actual change. Below, I've linked some sources for further investigation: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Show-Book-History-Correspondents/dp/1455565385"><i>The Daily Show: The Book</i></a> is the most comprehensive source for the Daily Show's history. It incorporates
         oral accounts of the show's history into one, cohesive narrative. Since it was published a few years ago, it does not
        cover Trevor Noah's tenure as host. </li>
      <li> <a href= "https://daily.jstor.org/daily-show-political-influence/"> This article</a>, which describes some small studies conducted on the effect of The Daily Show on its viewers' perception of the news,
      is an interesting look into The Daily Show's impact at the height of its popularity. </li>
      <li> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stewart-Presents-America-Teachers/dp/0446691860"> America: The Book</a>, which was published by The Daily Show in 2006, is a good look into what the style of the program usually was.
      Taking on an authoritative textbook format, the book satirizes the teaching of American history in the United States. </li>
    </ul>
